# CS-254-Machine-Learning-Semester-Project
Kevin Encarnacao &amp; Evan Hinchliffe's CS 254 Machine Learning Repository

## Instructions and Notes:
* Our last run of output cells should be visible. The whole notebook should only take about 5 minutes to run all together.
* The code is setup to be run in our particular project folder on Google Drive via Colab. Paths will need to be updated if you want to run it yourself.
* All variables are clearly commented if you want to change anything, as are all the functions.
* The notebook is commented in a way as to guide the viewer along our process of constructing it.
